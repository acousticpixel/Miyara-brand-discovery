## February 6, 2025 — User Interview: Cristina Galam

### Summary

Cristina's session revealed key UX issues around guidance, microphone control, and conversation flow. Users need clearer step-by-step direction, better mic state visibility, and a more conversational one-at-a-time interaction pattern. The session ended abruptly without a proper conclusion, breaking expectations of a natural back-and-forth dialogue.

### Issues Identified

1. **Unclear next steps** — User didn't know what to do next at various points in the session. Lacks clear guidance or prompts to move forward.

2. **Microphone control confusion** — Mic stayed open without the user realizing it. No obvious way to turn it off or clear indication of mic state.

3. **Overwhelmed by multiple words at once** — Three value words were presented simultaneously when the user expected one word at a time. The pacing felt rushed and unclear.

4. **Incomplete session ending** — The session didn't reach a proper conclusion. User expected a conversational back-and-forth exchange but the chat didn't complete the full flow.

5. **Avatar video needs replacing** — The current avatar doesn't look good. Video needs to be swapped out for a better one.

### Note on Test Participant

Christina is not the target audience — she participated as an unbiased user to surface general UX issues. The ideal target audience for future testing would be business owners actively looking for branding services.

### Positive Feedback

- **Design was well received** — Overall visual design and look of the app got positive feedback.
